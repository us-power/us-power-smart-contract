## The Problem

Renewable energy cooperatives generate clean energy every day — but **they can't prove it**.

- No standardized way to record generation
- No verifiable certificate that travels with the energy claim
- No access to ESG markets, carbon offsetting programs, or institutional buyers
- Manual, paper-based processes that nobody trusts

Meanwhile, companies and funds with ESG commitments are actively looking for verifiable renewable energy claims — and can't find them.

**The gap between cooperatives and buyers is a trust gap. US Power closes it.**

---

## The Solution

US Power is a cooperative management dashboard + on-chain certification infrastructure on **Stellar**.

Every kWh registered by a cooperative becomes a **proto-certificate**: a verifiable, on-chain claim tied to a real meter, a real cooperative, and a real time period.

```
Smart meter sends reading → POST /api/meters/readings
         ↓
US Power validates & mints token on Stellar (1 token = 1 kWh)
         ↓
Certificate is assigned to cooperative members
         ↓
External buyer (company / ESG fund) purchases certificate
         ↓
Buyer retires certificate on-chain (verifiable burn)
         ↓
Permanent, auditable proof on Stellar blockchain
```

No intermediaries. No PDFs. No trust required — the chain is the proof.

## How It Works — Full Platform Flow

### For Cooperatives

```
1. Register cooperative on US Power
2. Add smart meters (physical IoT devices)
3. Meters send generation readings automatically via API
4. US Power mints proto-certificates on Stellar
5. Manage members, view generation stats, track certificates
```

### For Buyers

```
1. Browse available certificates by cooperative / technology / period
2. Purchase certificates (linked to specific on-chain tokens)
3. Retire certificate → recorded permanently on Stellar
4. Receive auditable proof of renewable energy support
```

### Authentication

US Power supports two access methods — no setup required to try:

**Email + Password** (for admins, buyers, internal team)
```
/login → Supabase auth → JWT issued → Stellar wallet auto-assigned → /dashboard
```
> Try it: `demo@uspower.coop` / `Demo2026!`

**Stellar Wallet** (for cooperatives with Freighter / xBull / Lobstr)
```
Connect wallet → Server issues challenge → User signs with private key
→ Signature verified on-chain → JWT issued → /dashboard
```

Both methods issue the same JWT and give full platform access. Wallet users can additionally sign on-chain transactions.

## Stellar Integration — What's Actually On-Chain

This is not a wrapper. Stellar is load-bearing infrastructure:

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| **Certificate issuance** | Mint SEP-41 tokens directly on Stellar Testnet |
| **Certificate retirement** | On-chain burn, permanently auditable |
| **Member allocation** | `energy_distribution` contract splits tokens by participation % |
| **Governance** | `community_governance` contract for cooperative proposals |
| **Wallet auth** | Challenge-response signature verification (no gas, no tx) |
| **Token standard** | SEP-41 (fungible) with OpenZeppelin Stellar Pausable + Upgradeable |

### Deployed Contracts — Stellar Testnet

| Contract | Address | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `energy_token` | [`CCYOVOFD...MRPBA6`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCYOVOFDJ5BVBSI6HADLWETTUF3BU423MEAWBSBWV2X5UVNKSJMRPBA6) | SEP-41 token — 1 token = 1 kWh certified |
| `energy_distribution` | [`CBTDPLFN...NX2UDZ`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CBTDPLFNFGWVOD4HXDKW4EH5L3D2YGOY5CWTFCJM5TEWFL4VQTNX2UDZ) | Distributes certificates to members |
| `community_governance` | [`CCH2EXXN...BJD6YI`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCH2EXXNSDW2BAKBIPFAG6CCZS6LV4VJFUP2CZZCW5LEY4JOAXBJD6YI) | Cooperative on-chain governance |

Built with **OpenZeppelin Stellar Contracts v0.5.1** + **Soroban SDK 23.1.0** — 65 tests passing.

## Customer Discovery

We validated the problem directly with:

- **Energy cooperatives** in Argentina — confirmed the pain of not being able to sell renewable attributes
- **ESG compliance teams** — confirmed demand for verifiable, auditable certificates
- **Climate program coordinators** — confirmed interest in blockchain-based proof over PDFs

Key insight: the bottleneck isn't production — cooperatives generate plenty. The bottleneck is **verifiable proof**. US Power solves exactly that.

## Planned Stellar Ecosystem Integrations

US Power is designed to plug into Stellar's growing DeFi and payments ecosystem. Planned integrations from the [SCF Integration Track](https://stellar.gitbook.io/scf-handbook/scf-awards/build-award/integration-track/integration-list):

| Integration | What it unlocks for US Power |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| **[DeFindex](https://defindex.io)** | Cooperatives earn yield on certificate proceeds held in vaults — idle capital works while certificates wait for buyers |
| **[Blend Protocol](https://blend.capital)** | Use certificates as collateral for credit lines — cooperatives access working capital without selling |
| **[Soroswap](https://soroswap.finance)** | AMM liquidity pool for certificate tokens — enables price discovery and secondary market for renewable attributes |
| **USDC (Circle)** | Stablecoin payments for certificate purchases — buyers pay in USDC, cooperatives receive USDC, no FX volatility |
| **[Aquarius](https://aquarius.network)** | Liquidity incentives for BETOKEN/USDC pairs — bootstraps the certificate secondary market |
| **Fiat On/Off Ramp (SEP-24)** | Cooperatives receive payments in local fiat (ARS, COP, BRL) via Stellar anchors — no crypto knowledge required |
| **[Stellar Turrets / smart oracles](https://tss.stellar.org)** | Automated certificate minting triggered by verified IoT meter readings — removes manual intervention |

These integrations are load-bearing features on the product roadmap, not checkbox items. DeFindex is the most immediate — partial integration already exists in the codebase.
